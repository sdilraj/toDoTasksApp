#Assignment 2: Todo app!

#I have tested my application on iPhone SE
/*
*On my to do app, check mark = the task is completed and unchecked means = it is still not complete.
* I have made these ["Due Assignment 2", "Go Workout", "Write Essay", "Drink Coffee", "Fix Clock"] as basic tasks but the user * can always add or delete any tasks.
